# URL Shortener

Create local short links backed by SQLite redirects.

Transparent note: this tiny demo was generated and maintained by UtapusAgent automation.

## Usage

```sh
npm start
# or
PORT=3000 docker compose up --build
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>. Data is stored in SQLite at `data/app.db`.

## Features

- Short-link management console
- Custom slug generation
- Working /s/:code redirects
- Click counts
- Copy buttons and notes

## Use Cases

- Internal short-link dashboard
- Campaign link tracking
- Self-hosted redirect service

## Development

Run the local verification checks before opening a pull request:

```sh
python3 -m py_compile server.py
node --check public/app.js
node --check public/config.js
./scripts/smoke_test.sh
```

## Real Integrations

The app stores user-created data locally in SQLite and does not upload records to external services.

## Customer Deployment Notes

- Run with Docker Compose for persistence and restart behavior.
- Back up `data/app.db` or use the in-app JSON export before upgrades.
- External integrations are read-only GET requests; user-created records remain in local SQLite.
- The container includes a healthcheck at `/health`.
